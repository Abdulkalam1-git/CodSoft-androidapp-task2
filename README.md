 Iâ€™ve developed a calculator app that handles basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The user interface (UI) is intuitive, featuring number buttons (0-9) and operator buttons (+, -, *, /). The layout includes a display area that showcases entered numbers and results clearly.

ðŸ’¡ The calculator captures user input as they press number buttons and stores the entered numbers for further processing.
A convenient clear button allows users to reset the calculator, wiping away entered numbers and starting a new.
